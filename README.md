# Dataframes

I am a practitioner using dataframes in Python and Julia almost on a daily basis. 

Please find meta info about this repo here: 
https://mase69.github.io/dssb/

I elaborate there on my experiences, best practices and point to the best resources on the web that I found so far on dataframes.
Here you can see what I needed to solve my actual data science problems.

In the references, you find 'all' about dataframes.
However, mostly, you need just one solution that works, not all possible solutions.
Finding that one solution can still take an awful amount of your time.

Recently, for instance, it took me ages to find out how to get my dataframe in Julia transposed.
